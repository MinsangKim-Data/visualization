# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 

- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did. How could this data visualization have been improved?        Examples taken from https://datavizproject.com
      
     - GOOD:
     I have selected an example of a good data visualization as a proportional tree chart (square). It is good because you can quickly compare and contrast the proportions relative to each other as the squares are located side by side. In addition, some color contrast between the squares makes it easy to visually differentiate between the squares. This format works well for datasets with a manageable number of categories. Each square occupies its space without overlapping or creating visual clutter. This simplistic, clean grid-like layout aligns with the principles of minalism and keeps the focus on the data itself. The data visualization can be improved with labels to provide context and perhaps some interactivity can be added so some more specific information or data can be shown without sacrificing simplicity. Maybe this can be improved my playing around with different color scales to improve color contrast, yet without confusing the viwer.


    - BAD:
    For an example of a bad data visualization, I chose multi-level donut chart because of the complicated nature of its design. Multi-level donut chart has a concentric design with a single item in the inner most circle, with each following concentric ring showing the breakup of the said item. Conceptually, it may be good on paper; however, the multiple levels and concentric design makes it difficult for viewers to decode the meaning of the visualization. In addition, moving from one hierarchy to another and comparing the two can be confusing and challening, especially if the segments are similar in size. Furthermore, when the rings are segmented into several levels, the segments will become very small, making it inaccessible for viewers. Ideally, this visualization can be improved by changing its format to a treemap, where there is more directional flow, where viewers can understand hierarchy at a single glance. As always, interactivity can be incorporated where more information can become available with a hover over with a mouse, while not sacrificing simplicity.  



- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
